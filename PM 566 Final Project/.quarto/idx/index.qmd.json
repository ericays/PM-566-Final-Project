The focus of this analysis is to explore how sex, race, median income, and age at diagnosis are associated with survival outcomes for children diagnosed with leukemia.\n\n### **Research Question:**\n\nThe primary question addressed in this project is:\\\n*What demographic factors (e.g., sex, race, median income, age) are associated with the likelihood of longer survival times in pediatric patients under age 10 diagnosed with malignant leukemia in the U.S.?*\n\nThe project seeks to identify if disparities in survival times exist based on sex, race, socioeconomic status, and age, contributing to a deeper understanding of how these factors influence the likelihood of longer survival and, ultimately, the development of targeted healthcare interventions for at-risk populations.\n\n### **Data and Methods:**\n\nThe dataset used in this analysis is derived from the SEER program, specifically the \"*Incidence - SEER Research Limited-Field Data, 22 Registries, Nov 2023 Sub (2000-2021) - Linked to County Attributes - Time Dependent (1990-2022) Income/Rurality, 1969-2022 Counties*\" registry. The dataset covers a wide range of variables, including patient demographics, age, year of diagnosis, site of leukemia, year of death, and median household income. After cleaning and wrangling the data (removing missing values and transforming variables), the focus is on deceased patients to analyze survival time.\n\nThe following methods were applied:\n\n-   **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Renaming variables for simplicity, converting categorical variables to numeric where appropriate, and filtering out \"alive\" patients to focus on those who have passed away.\n\n-   **Exploratory Analysis**: Using summary statistics and visualizations to investigate trends in survival time based on demographic factors.\n\n-   **Survival Time Calculation**: Creating a new variable for survival time by subtracting the year of diagnosis from the year of death.\n\n### **Key Insights and Visualizations:**\n\nThe project includes interactive visualizations to explore the relationship between demographic factors (sex, race, median income, and age) and survival time. Some key insights include:\n\n-   Survival trends across different races and sexes.\n\n-   The impact of median household income on survival.\n\n-   Age-related trends in survival for pediatric leukemia patients.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThis project seeks to explore the demographic disparities in survival outcomes among pediatric leukemia patients, focusing on key insights that could guide healthcare strategies and interventions aimed at improving survival rates in underserved populations.\n\n## Interactive Visualizations\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\n# Read in dataset\nleuk <- read.csv(\"/Users/ericashin/Downloads/Pediatric Malignant Leukemia Cancer Cases in the US (2000-2021, Ages Under 10 Only).csv\")\n```\n\n```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}\n# Load in libraries\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(stringr)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(kableExtra) #extra styling for tables\nlibrary(paletteer) #color palette\nlibrary(plotly)\n\n# Rename variable column names\nleuk <- leuk |>\n  rename(id = Patient.ID,\n         sex = Sex,\n         race = Race.recode..White..Black..Other.,\n         eth = Race.ethnicity,\n         age = Age.recode.with.single.ages.and.90.,\n         age_range = Age.recode.with..1.year.olds,\n         year_dx = Year.of.diagnosis,\n         site = Site.recode.ICD.O.3.WHO.2008,\n         level = Behavior.code.ICD.O.3,\n         year_death = Year.of.death.recode,\n         med_income = Median.household.income.inflation.adj.to.2022,\n         rep_source = Type.of.Reporting.Source,\n         loc_type = Rural.Urban.Continuum.Code)\n\nleuk <- leuk |> filter(!is.na(med_income))\n\n# Change age from character to numeric variable\nleuk <- leuk |>\n  mutate(age = as.integer(sub(\" years\", \"\", age)))\n\n# Convert year_death into numeric variable\nleuk$year_death <- as.numeric(as.character(leuk$year_death))\n\n# Filter out NA (cases that are still alive) and only keeping cases with year of death\nleuk <- leuk |>\n  filter(!is.na(year_death) & !is.na(year_dx))\n\n# Create new variable for survival time in years (called surv)\nleuk <- leuk |>\n  mutate(surv = year_death -
