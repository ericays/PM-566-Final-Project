    "title": "Understanding Survival Outcomes in U.S. Pediatric Leukemia Cases: A Demographic Analysis",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This project investigates the demographic factors influencing the survival time of pediatric leukemia patients (under age 10) in the U.S. from 2000-2021 using data from the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) program, which collects cancer incidence data across a significant portion of the U.S. population. The focus of this analysis is to explore how sex, race, median income, and age at diagnosis are associated with survival outcomes for children diagnosed with leukemia. \n\n\n\nThe primary question addressed in this project is:\nWhat demographic factors (e.g., sex, race, median income, age) are associated with the likelihood of longer survival times in pediatric patients under age 10 diagnosed with malignant leukemia in the U.S.?\nThe project seeks to identify if disparities in survival outcomes exist based on demographic factors such as sex, race, socioeconomic status, and age, focusing on key insights that could guide healthcare strategies and interventions aimed at improving survival rates in underserved populations. \n\n\n\nThe dataset used in this analysis is derived from the SEER program, specifically the “Incidence - SEER Research Limited-Field Data, 22 Registries, Nov 2023 Sub (2000-2021) - Linked to County Attributes - Time Dependent (1990-2022) Income/Rurality, 1969-2022 Counties” registry. The dataset covers a wide range of variables, including patient demographics, age, year of diagnosis, site of leukemia, year of death, and median household income. After cleaning and wrangling the data (removing missing values and transforming variables), the focus is on deceased patients to analyze survival time.\nThe following methods were applied:\n\nData Cleaning and Transformation: Renaming variables for simplicity, converting categorical variables to numeric where appropriate, and filtering out “alive” patients to focus on those who have passed away.\nExploratory Analysis: Using summary statistics and visualizations to investigate trends in survival time based on demographic factors.\nSurvival Time Calculation: Creating a new variable for survival time by subtracting the year of diagnosis from the year of death. \n\n\n\n\nThe project includes interactive visualizations to explore the relationship between demographic factors (sex, race, median income, and age) and survival time. Some key insights include:\n\nSurvival trends across different races and sexes.\nThe impact of median household income on survival.\nAge-related trends in survival for pediatric leukemia patients. \n\n\n\n\nThe preliminary analysis indicates that several demographic factors—such as gender, income level, and age—are associated with longer average survival times in deceased pediatric patients under age 10 diagnosed with malignant leukemia in the US. Specifically, males, older children, and those from higher-income backgrounds generally exhibited longer average survival times. While these findings suggest potential disparities, further analysis is needed to explore the relationships in more depth."

    "text": "1. Introduction\nBackground:\nLeukemia, a type of blood cancer characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal white blood cells in the bone marrow, is the most common type of cancer diagnosed in children - accounting for approximately 28% of all pediatric cancers in the United States. The incidence of leukemia in the pediatric population has raised public health concerns due to its impact on the long-term survival and quality of life of young patients.\nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH) collects cancer incidence data from population-based cancer registries covering approximately 47.9 percent of the US population in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER). The SEER registries collect data on patient demographics, primary tumor site, tumor morphology, stage at diagnosis, first course of treatment, and more. In this report, I focus specifically on leukemia cases within the SEER dataset to investigate trends and factors influencing survival among pediatric patients diagnosed with this condition.\nQuestion of Interest:\nThis report aims to address the following research question: What demographic factors (e.g., sex, race, median income, age) are associated with the likelihood of longer survival times in deceased pediatric patients under age 10 diagnosed with malignant leukemia in the US?\nWhile advancements in medical research and treatment methods have led to improved survival rates, disparities persist based on demographic factors such as sex, race, socioeconomic status, and age. Understanding these disparities is crucial for developing targeted interventions that can enhance treatment efficacy and support systems for vulnerable populations."

    "section": "2. Methods",
    "text": "2. Methods\nNIH provides a statistical software tool (available for download on their website) called SEER*Stat to access and analyze SEER data. Once I gained access to SEER*Stat, I looked through the list of registries and curated my dataset by selecting specific variables I wanted to examine in a case listing session.\nMy dataset comes from the specific NIH SEER registry called “Incidence - SEER Research Limited-Field Data, 22 Registries, Nov 2023 Sub (2000-2021) - Linked To County Attributes - Time Dependent (1990-2022) Income/Rurality, 1969-2022 Counties.” I chose to create my dataset based off this specific registry because it has the largest geographic coverage available - approximately 47.9% of the U.S. population (based on 2020 census).\nTo explore the question of interest, my dataset focuses on the following 13 variables:\n\nPatient ID: Integer identifier for each patient.\nSex: Character variable indicating the patient’s sex (e.g., “Female”, “Male”).\nRace (Recode: White, Black, Other): Character variable representing the patient’s race. The variable name was taken directly from the dataset (i.e., recoding was performed by SEER).\nRace Ethnicity: Character variable detailing the specific ethnicity of the patient.\nAge (Recode with Single Ages and 90+): Character variable indicating the patient’s age. The variable name was taken directly from the dataset (i.e., recoding was performed by SEER).\nAge (Recode with &lt;1 Year Olds): Character variable representing age ranges. The variable name was taken directly from the dataset (i.e., recoding was performed by SEER).\nYear of Diagnosis: Integer indicating the year the patient was diagnosed.\nSite (Recode ICD-O-3/WHO 2008): Character variable specifying the type of leukemia diagnosed. The variable name was taken directly from the dataset (i.e., recoding was performed by SEER).\nBehavior Code (ICD-O-3): Character variable indicating the malignancy status.\nYear of Death (Recode): Character variable denoting whether the patient is alive or the year of death. The variable name was taken directly from the dataset (i.e., recoding was performed by SEER).\nType of Reporting Source: Character variable describing the source of the cancer data (e.g., hospital or clinic).\nMedian Household Income (Inflation Adjusted to 2022): Character variable representing the income bracket of the patient’s household.\nRural-Urban Continuum Code: Character variable indicating the population type of the area where the patient resides.\n\nData Exploration Tools:\nThe following tools were used to explore the data.\n\ndim(): Used to look at the dimensions of the initial dataset (26,916 observations by 13 variables).\nstr(): Provided information about the types of variables contained in the initial dataset (2 integer and 11 character variables).\ncolnames(): Provided information about the variable or column names.\nhead() and tail(): Utilized to look at the first and last six observations.\ntable(): Used to count occurrences of specific variables.\nsummary(): Provided statistical summaries like mean, median, min, max, and quartiles for specific variables.\n\nCleaning and Wrangling:\nTo clean the data, I first renamed the columns to make the variable names simpler and easier to use for coding purposes. Then, I checked for any missing observations in the key variables (sex, race, age, age range, and median income). Only the variable for median income (med_income) had missing observations, so I filtered them out of my dataset.\nFor my question of interest, I wanted to focus on the survival time for patients who had already passed away, so I filtered out observations that were categorized as “Alive at last contact” and only kept patients that have a year of death. It is important to note that this may introduce some bias in my dataset as factors associated with better survival will be less common in the data. After filtering, the dataset dimensions were 3457 observations by 14 variables.\nNext, I noticed that the variables for year of death (year_death) and single ages (age) were character variables, so I converted them to numeric variables for easier calculations and visualizations. Finally, I created a new variable (surv) to calculate the survival time for each patient by subtracting the year of diagnosis from the year of death.\n\n# Rename variable column names\nleuk &lt;- leuk |&gt;\n  rename(id = Patient.ID,\n         sex = Sex,\n         race = Race.recode..White..Black..Other.,\n         eth = Race.ethnicity,\n         age = Age.recode.with.single.ages.and.90.,\n         age_range = Age.recode.with..1.year.olds,\n         year_dx = Year.of.diagnosis,\n         site = Site.recode.ICD.O.3.WHO.2008,\n         level = Behavior.code.ICD.O.3,\n         year_death = Year.of.death.recode,\n         med_income = Median.household.income.inflation.adj.to.2022,\n         rep_source = Type.of.Reporting.Source,\n         loc_type = Rural.Urban.Continuum.Code)\n\n# Check for missing observations in key variables\n#mean(is.na(leuk$sex))\n#mean(is.na(leuk$race))\n#mean(is.na(leuk$med_income))\n#mean(is.na(leuk$age))\n#mean(is.na(leuk$age_range))\n\nleuk &lt;- leuk |&gt; filter(!is.na(med_income))\n\n# Change age from character to numeric variable\nleuk &lt;- leuk |&gt;\n  mutate(age = as.integer(sub(\" years\", \"\", age)))\n\n# Convert year_death into numeric variable\nleuk$year_death &lt;- as.numeric(as.character(leuk$year_death))\n\n# Filter out NA (cases that are still alive) and only keeping cases with year of death\nleuk &lt;- leuk |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(year_death) & !is.na(year_dx))\n\n# Create new variable for survival time in years (called surv)\nleuk &lt;- leuk |&gt;\n  mutate(surv = year_death - year_dx)"

    "text": "4. Conclusion\nIn analyzing the data, it was found that males had a higher average survival time (2.494 years) compared to females (2.168 years). Among racial categories, “Unknown” had the highest average survival time at 2.450 years, closely followed by “Other (American Indian/AK Native, Asian/Pacific Islander)” at 2.446 years. However, it is important to note that the majority of patients were classified as “White” (2703 out of 3457 patients or 78%) while the “Unknown” category contained only 20 patients (5.8%), compared to 307 for “Other” (8.9%) and 427 for “Black” (12.4%). This discrepancy suggests that average survival times for the smaller categories may be more susceptible to outliers, especially in the “Unknown” group, which exhibited an unusually high average survival time of around 15 years for patients approximately 2.5 years old.\nAdditionally, there appears to be a positive association between median income and average survival time, indicating that higher income is correlated with better survival outcomes. Age also played a significant role; the majority of observations were in the 1-4 and 5-9 year ranges. Newborns (0 years) showed significantly lower average survival times, likely due to their increased vulnerability to disease as well the age range spanning less years than the other categories.\nOverall, preliminary analysis suggests that demographic factors such as being male, coming from a higher-income household, and being older are associated with longer survival times in deceased pediatric patients under age 10 diagnosed with malignant leukemia in the US."

    "text": "2. Methods\nThe data for this analysis was sourced from the SEER registries, which provides comprehensive cancer statistics and serves as a crucial resource for understanding trends in cancer incidence, treatment, and survival across the United States. To access and analyze the SEER data, the statistical software tool SEER*Stat was used. This tool allows for the selection and analysis of variables within the SEER registries and is available for download on the NCI’s website.\nThe dataset utilized in this report comes from the SEER registry titled “Incidence - SEER Research Limited-Field Data, 22 Registries, Nov 2023 Sub (2000-2021) - Linked to County Attributes - Time Dependent (1990-2022) Income/Rurality, 1969-2022 Counties.” This particular registry was chosen due to its extensive geographic coverage, representing approximately 47.9% of the U.S. population, as based on the 2020 U.S. Census. The dataset for the report was curated by selecting specific variables from the registry and offers a comprehensive view of the factors influencing survival among pediatric leukemia patients, with a focus on key demographic variables such as sex, race, and socioeconomic status.\nTo explore the question of interest, the dataset for this report focuses on the following 13 variables:\n\nPatient ID: Integer identifier for each patient.\nSex: Character variable indicating the patient’s sex (e.g., “Female”, “Male”).\nRace (Recode: White, Black, Other): Character variable representing the patient’s race.\nRace Ethnicity: Character variable detailing the specific ethnicity of the patient.\nAge (Recode with Single Ages and 90+): Character variable indicating the patient’s age.\nAge (Recode with &lt;1 Year Olds): Character variable representing age ranges.\nYear of Diagnosis: Integer indicating the year the patient was diagnosed.\nSite (Recode ICD-O-3/WHO 2008): Character variable specifying the type of leukemia diagnosed.\nBehavior Code (ICD-O-3): Character variable indicating the malignancy status.\nYear of Death (Recode): Character variable denoting whether the patient is alive or the year of death.\nType of Reporting Source: Character variable describing the source of the cancer data (e.g., hospital or clinic).\nMedian Household Income (Inflation Adjusted to 2022): Character variable representing the income bracket of the patient’s household.\nRural-Urban Continuum Code: Character variable indicating the population type of the area where the patient resides.\n\nThe names of all 13 variables were taken directly from SEER, with recodings also performed by SEER.\n\nData Exploration Tools:\nThe following tools were used to explore the data.\n\ndim(): Used to look at the dimensions of the initial dataset (26,916 observations by 13 variables).\nstr(): Provided information about the types of variables contained in the initial dataset (2 integer and 11 character variables).\ncolnames(): Provided information about the variable or column names.\nhead() and tail(): Utilized to look at the first and last six observations.\ntable(): Used to count occurrences of specific variables.\nsummary(): Provided statistical summaries like mean, median, min, max, and quartiles for specific variables.\n\n\nCleaning and Wrangling:\nTo clean the data, the column names were renamed to simplify the variable names for easier use in coding. Missing observations in key variables (sex, race, age, age range, and median income) were then addressed. The only variable with missing values was median income (med_income), and the corresponding observations were removed from the dataset.\nFor the analysis, the focus was placed on the survival time of patients who had already passed away. Therefore, observations categorized as “Alive at last contact” were excluded, retaining only those with a recorded year of death. It is important to note that this filtering process may introduce some bias, as factors associated with better survival are less likely to be represented in the dataset. After filtering, the dataset contained 3,457 observations and 14 variables.\nSubsequently, the variables for year of death (year_death) and age (age) were originally character variables, so they were converted to numeric types for easier calculations and visualizations. A new variable, “surv,” was then created to calculate the survival time for each patient by subtracting the year of diagnosis from the year of death."

    "text": "4. Conclusion and Summary\nIn conclusion, the preliminary analysis indicates that several demographic factors—such as gender, income level, and age—are associated with longer survival times in deceased pediatric patients under age 10 diagnosed with malignant leukemia in the US. Males, older children, and those from higher-income backgrounds generally exhibited longer survival times.\nIt is important to note that the distribution of patients across racial categories was uneven, with the majority classified as “White” (78% of the dataset). The smaller sample sizes in categories such as “Unknown” (5.8%) and “Other” (8.9%) suggest that these groups’ survival data may be more sensitive to outliers, particularly in the “Unknown” category, which reported unusually high survival times, possibly due to a small number of cases with long survival.\nFurther analysis is required to explore these relationships in more depth and account for potential confounding variables.\nThe analysis reveals potential disparities that warrant further investigation and suggests that targeted healthcare strategies may be necessary to address these disparities. These findings can inform future research and guide healthcare professionals in providing better support to vulnerable pediatric populations affected by leukemia."

    "text": "This project investigates the demographic factors influencing the survival time of pediatric leukemia patients (under age 10) in the U.S. from 2000-2021 using data from the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) program, which collects cancer incidence data across a significant portion of the U.S. population. The focus of this analysis is to explore how sex, race, median income, and age at diagnosis are associated with survival outcomes for children diagnosed with leukemia.\n\n\n\nThe primary question addressed in this project is:\nWhat demographic factors (e.g., sex, race, median income, age) are associated with the likelihood of longer survival times in pediatric patients under age 10 diagnosed with malignant leukemia in the U.S.?\nThe project seeks to identify if disparities in survival times exist based on sex, race, socioeconomic status, and age, contributing to a deeper understanding of how these factors influence the likelihood of longer survival and, ultimately, the development of targeted healthcare interventions for at-risk populations.\n\n\n\nThe dataset used in this analysis is derived from the SEER program, specifically the “Incidence - SEER Research Limited-Field Data, 22 Registries, Nov 2023 Sub (2000-2021) - Linked to County Attributes - Time Dependent (1990-2022) Income/Rurality, 1969-2022 Counties” registry. The dataset covers a wide range of variables, including patient demographics, age, year of diagnosis, site of leukemia, year of death, and median household income. After cleaning and wrangling the data (removing missing values and transforming variables), the focus is on deceased patients to analyze survival time.\nThe following methods were applied:\n\nData Cleaning and Transformation: Renaming variables for simplicity, converting categorical variables to numeric where appropriate, and filtering out “alive” patients to focus on those who have passed away.\nExploratory Analysis: Using summary statistics and visualizations to investigate trends in survival time based on demographic factors.\nSurvival Time Calculation: Creating a new variable for survival time by subtracting the year of diagnosis from the year of death.\n\n\n\n\nThe project includes interactive visualizations to explore the relationship between demographic factors (sex, race, median income, and age) and survival time. Some key insights include:\n\nSurvival trends across different races and sexes.\nThe impact of median household income on survival.\nAge-related trends in survival for pediatric leukemia patients.\n\n\n\n\nThis project seeks to explore the demographic disparities in survival outcomes among pediatric leukemia patients, focusing on key insights that could guide healthcare strategies and interventions aimed at improving survival rates in underserved populations."

Interactive Barchart of Patient Count/Sample Size by Race\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe majority of patients in the dataset were classified as “White” (2703 out of 3457 patients or 78%) while the “Unknown” category contained only 20 patients (5.8%), compared to 307 for “Other” (8.9%) and 427 for “Black” (12.4%).\n\nVisualization 4. Interactive Line Plot of Average Survival Time by Age of Diagnosis and Race\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The discrepancy in sample sizes among racial groups suggests that average survival times for the smaller race categories may be more susceptible to outliers, especially in the “Unknown” group, which exhibited an unusually high average survival time of around 15 years for patients approximately 2.5 years old.\n\nVisualization 5. Interactive Scatterplot of Average Survival Time (Years) by Median Income\n\n\n\n\n\n\n There appears to be a positive association between median income and average survival time, indicating that higher income is correlated with better survival outcomes."

    "text": "This project investigates the demographic factors influencing the survival time of pediatric leukemia patients (under age 10) in the U.S. from 2000-2021 using data from the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) program, which collects cancer incidence data across a significant portion of the U.S. population. The focus of this analysis is to explore how sex, race, median income, and age at diagnosis are associated with survival outcomes for children diagnosed with leukemia. \n\n\n\nThe primary question addressed in this project is:\nWhat demographic factors (e.g., sex, race, median income, age) are associated with the likelihood of longer survival times in pediatric patients under age 10 diagnosed with malignant leukemia in the U.S.?\nThe project seeks to identify if disparities in survival outcomes exist based on demographic factors such as sex, race, socioeconomic status, and age, focusing on key insights that could guide healthcare strategies and interventions aimed at improving survival rates in underserved populations. \n\n\n\nThe dataset used in this analysis is derived from the SEER program, specifically the “Incidence - SEER Research Limited-Field Data, 22 Registries, Nov 2023 Sub (2000-2021) - Linked to County Attributes - Time Dependent (1990-2022) Income/Rurality, 1969-2022 Counties” registry. The dataset covers a wide range of variables, including patient demographics, age, year of diagnosis, site of leukemia, year of death, and median household income. After cleaning and wrangling the data (removing missing values and transforming variables), the focus is on deceased patients to analyze survival time.\nThe following methods were applied:\n\nData Cleaning and Transformation: Renaming variables for simplicity, converting categorical variables to numeric where appropriate, and filtering out “alive” patients to focus on those who have passed away.\nExploratory Analysis: Using summary statistics and visualizations to investigate trends in survival time based on demographic factors.\nSurvival Time Calculation: Creating a new variable for survival time by subtracting the year of diagnosis from the year of death. \n\n\n\n\nThe project includes interactive visualizations to explore the relationship between demographic factors (sex, race, median income, and age) and survival time. Some key insights include:\n\nSurvival trends across different races and sexes.\nThe impact of median household income on survival.\nAge-related trends in survival for pediatric leukemia patients. \n\n\n\n\nThe preliminary analysis indicates that several demographic factors—such as gender, income level, and age—are associated with longer average survival times in deceased pediatric patients under age 10 diagnosed with malignant leukemia in the US. Specifically, males, older children, and those from higher-income backgrounds generally exhibited longer average survival times. While these findings suggest potential disparities, further analysis is needed to explore the relationships in more depth."
