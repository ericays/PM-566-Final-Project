    "text": "1. Introduction\nBackground:\nLeukemia, a type of blood cancer characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal white blood cells in the bone marrow, is the most common type of cancer diagnosed in children - accounting for approximately 28% of all pediatric cancers in the United States. The incidence of leukemia in the pediatric population has raised public health concerns due to its impact on the long-term survival and quality of life of young patients.\nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH) collects cancer incidence data from population-based cancer registries covering approximately 47.9 percent of the US population in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER). The SEER registries collect data on patient demographics, primary tumor site, tumor morphology, stage at diagnosis, first course of treatment, and more. In this report, I focus specifically on leukemia cases within the SEER dataset to investigate trends and factors influencing survival among pediatric patients diagnosed with this condition.\nQuestion of Interest:\nThis report aims to address the following research question: What demographic factors (e.g., sex, race, median income, age) are associated with the likelihood of longer survival times in deceased pediatric patients under age 10 diagnosed with malignant leukemia in the US?\nWhile advancements in medical research and treatment methods have led to improved survival rates, disparities persist based on demographic factors such as sex, race, socioeconomic status, and age. Understanding these disparities is crucial for developing targeted interventions that can enhance treatment efficacy and support systems for vulnerable populations."

    "text": "2. Methods\nNIH provides a statistical software tool (available for download on their website) called SEER*Stat to access and analyze SEER data. Once I gained access to SEER*Stat, I looked through the list of registries and curated my dataset by selecting specific variables I wanted to examine in a case listing session.\nMy dataset comes from the specific NIH SEER registry called “Incidence - SEER Research Limited-Field Data, 22 Registries, Nov 2023 Sub (2000-2021) - Linked To County Attributes - Time Dependent (1990-2022) Income/Rurality, 1969-2022 Counties.” I chose to create my dataset based off this specific registry because it has the largest geographic coverage available - approximately 47.9% of the U.S. population (based on 2020 census).\nTo explore the question of interest, my dataset focuses on the following 13 variables:\n\nPatient ID: Integer identifier for each patient.\nSex: Character variable indicating the patient’s sex (e.g., “Female”, “Male”).\nRace (Recode: White, Black, Other): Character variable representing the patient’s race. The variable name was taken directly from the dataset (i.e., recoding was performed by SEER).\nRace Ethnicity: Character variable detailing the specific ethnicity of the patient.\nAge (Recode with Single Ages and 90+): Character variable indicating the patient’s age. The variable name was taken directly from the dataset (i.e., recoding was performed by SEER).\nAge (Recode with &lt;1 Year Olds): Character variable representing age ranges. The variable name was taken directly from the dataset (i.e., recoding was performed by SEER).\nYear of Diagnosis: Integer indicating the year the patient was diagnosed.\nSite (Recode ICD-O-3/WHO 2008): Character variable specifying the type of leukemia diagnosed. The variable name was taken directly from the dataset (i.e., recoding was performed by SEER).\nBehavior Code (ICD-O-3): Character variable indicating the malignancy status.\nYear of Death (Recode): Character variable denoting whether the patient is alive or the year of death. The variable name was taken directly from the dataset (i.e., recoding was performed by SEER).\nType of Reporting Source: Character variable describing the source of the cancer data (e.g., hospital or clinic).\nMedian Household Income (Inflation Adjusted to 2022): Character variable representing the income bracket of the patient’s household.\nRural-Urban Continuum Code: Character variable indicating the population type of the area where the patient resides.\n\nData Exploration Tools:\nThe following tools were used to explore the data.\n\ndim(): Used to look at the dimensions of the initial dataset (26,916 observations by 13 variables).\nstr(): Provided information about the types of variables contained in the initial dataset (2 integer and 11 character variables).\ncolnames(): Provided information about the variable or column names.\nhead() and tail(): Utilized to look at the first and last six observations.\ntable(): Used to count occurrences of specific variables.\nsummary(): Provided statistical summaries like mean, median, min, max, and quartiles for specific variables.\n\nCleaning and Wrangling:\nTo clean the data, I first renamed the columns to make the variable names simpler and easier to use for coding purposes. Then, I checked for any missing observations in the key variables (sex, race, age, age range, and median income). Only the variable for median income (med_income) had missing observations, so I filtered them out of my dataset.\nFor my question of interest, I wanted to focus on the survival time for patients who had already passed away, so I filtered out observations that were categorized as “Alive at last contact” and only kept patients that have a year of death. It is important to note that this may introduce some bias in my dataset as factors associated with better survival will be less common in the data. After filtering, the dataset dimensions were 3457 observations by 14 variables.\nNext, I noticed that the variables for year of death (year_death) and single ages (age) were character variables, so I converted them to numeric variables for easier calculations and visualizations. Finally, I created a new variable (surv) to calculate the survival time for each patient by subtracting the year of diagnosis from the year of death.\n\n# Rename variable column names\nleuk &lt;- leuk |&gt;\n  rename(id = Patient.ID,\n         sex = Sex,\n         race = Race.recode..White..Black..Other.,\n         eth = Race.ethnicity,\n         age = Age.recode.with.single.ages.and.90.,\n         age_range = Age.recode.with..1.year.olds,\n         year_dx = Year.of.diagnosis,\n         site = Site.recode.ICD.O.3.WHO.2008,\n         level = Behavior.code.ICD.O.3,\n         year_death = Year.of.death.recode,\n         med_income = Median.household.income.inflation.adj.to.2022,\n         rep_source = Type.of.Reporting.Source,\n         loc_type = Rural.Urban.Continuum.Code)\n\n# Check for missing observations in key variables\n#mean(is.na(leuk$sex))\n#mean(is.na(leuk$race))\n#mean(is.na(leuk$med_income))\n#mean(is.na(leuk$age))\n#mean(is.na(leuk$age_range))\n\nleuk &lt;- leuk |&gt; filter(!is.na(med_income))\n\n# Change age from character to numeric variable\nleuk &lt;- leuk |&gt;\n  mutate(age = as.integer(sub(\" years\", \"\", age)))\n\n# Convert year_death into numeric variable\nleuk$year_death &lt;- as.numeric(as.character(leuk$year_death))\n\n# Filter out NA (cases that are still alive) and only keeping cases with year of death\nleuk &lt;- leuk |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(year_death) & !is.na(year_dx))\n\n# Create new variable for survival time in years (called surv)\nleuk &lt;- leuk |&gt;\n  mutate(surv = year_death - year_dx)"

    "text": "4. Conclusion\nIn analyzing the data, it was found that males had a higher average survival time (2.494 years) compared to females (2.168 years). Among racial categories, “Unknown” had the highest average survival time at 2.450 years, closely followed by “Other (American Indian/AK Native, Asian/Pacific Islander)” at 2.446 years. However, it is important to note that the majority of patients were classified as “White” (2703 out of 3457 patients or 78%) while the “Unknown” category contained only 20 patients (5.8%), compared to 307 for “Other” (8.9%) and 427 for “Black” (12.4%). This discrepancy suggests that average survival times for the smaller categories may be more susceptible to outliers, especially in the “Unknown” group, which exhibited an unusually high average survival time of around 15 years for patients approximately 2.5 years old.\nAdditionally, there appears to be a positive association between median income and average survival time, indicating that higher income is correlated with better survival outcomes. Age also played a significant role; the majority of observations were in the 1-4 and 5-9 year ranges. Newborns (0 years) showed significantly lower average survival times, likely due to their increased vulnerability to disease as well the age range spanning less years than the other categories.\nOverall, preliminary analysis suggests that demographic factors such as being male, coming from a higher-income household, and being older are associated with longer survival times in deceased pediatric patients under age 10 diagnosed with malignant leukemia in the US."
